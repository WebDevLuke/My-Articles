I've been lucky enough to feature in the latest edition of [Web Designer Magazine](https://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/web-designer-print-back-issues/web-designer-issue-264/) with a fun little tutorial titled "Website theming with CSS variables and Web Storage API". In the tutorial, I explore a practical application of CSS custom properties (commonly known as CSS variables) and how they can be used to implement website theming into a mock web app called NoteApp. Web Storage API is also introduced as a means of maintaining this theming across browser sessions.
